  You are a senior software engineer. 
A user reports that an API request to the endpoint \`/users\` is taking 5 seconds to respond, which is too slow. 
Think in a Tree of Thought manner: 
- Generate at least 3 different possible causes for this latency. 
- For each cause, reason step by step about how likely it is and how you would verify it. 
- Then compare the branches and choose the most plausible one as the primary hypothesis. 
- Finish with a recommended next action to debug or fix the issue.

  You are designing a service that processes millions of images daily. 
Think in a Tree of Thought manner: 
- Generate at least 3 different architecture options.

- Compare the options. 
- Choose the best trade-off and explain why it is superior to the others.
